sudo port install just
```

## Available Commands

### Development

- `just install` - Install npm dependencies
- `just dev` or `just boot` - Start development server
- `just start` - Install dependencies and start dev server (first-time setup)
- `just restart` - Clean cache and restart dev server

### Building

- `just build` - Build for production
- `just preview` - Preview production build locally
- `just deploy-preview` - Build and preview together

### Testing & Validation

- `just check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `just check-watch` - Watch mode for type checking
- `just pre-deploy` - Run all pre-deployment checks (clean, install, check, build)

### Deployment

- `just deploy` - Build and show deployment instructions
  - Outputs instructions for Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.

### Maintenance

- `just clean` - Remove build artifacts and caches
- `just clean-all` - Remove build artifacts AND node_modules
- `just info` - Show project information and available commands

### Default

- `just` (no command) - List all available commands

## Common Workflows

### First Time Setup
```bash
just start
# or
just install
just dev
```

### Daily Development
```bash
just dev
```

### Before Committing
```bash
just check
```

### Deploy to Production
```bash
just pre-deploy  # Runs all checks
just deploy      # Build and get deployment instructions
```

### Clean Restart (if something's broken)
```bash
just restart
# or for complete reset:
just clean-all
just start
```

## Examples

```bash
# Start fresh project
just start

# Check for type errors
just check

# Build and preview production
just deploy-preview

# Full pre-deployment validation
just pre-deploy

# Deploy to Netlify (after just deploy)
netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
```

## Why Just?

- **Simpler than Make**: No weird tab requirements, cleaner syntax
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, Windows
- **Task runner**: Purpose-built for command running (unlike make which is for building)
- **Documented**: Built-in help with `just --list`
- **Fast**: Written in Rust

## Alternatives

If you prefer not to use just, all commands are standard npm scripts:

```bash
npm install       # just install
npm run dev       # just dev
npm run build     # just build
npm run check     # just check
```
